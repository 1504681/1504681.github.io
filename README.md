Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently studying Malware Analysis courses.

ðŸ’» I have experience Reverse Engineering Software & Malware, and spend a lot of time writing C++ programs to read/write memory in common software.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m documenting all my progress, course notes, and malware writeups here on this blog!
