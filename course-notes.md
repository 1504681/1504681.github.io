# Malware Analysis General Notes

## Win32 Api

NT APIs in ntdll.dll are not officially documented -> find them at http://undocumented.ntinternals.net

NtCreateSection is an undocumented API usually used by malware for *Process Hollowing*

Process Hollowing
  - Legitimate process is loaded on the system to act as a *container* for malicious code.
  - Legit code is deallocated and replaced
  - Helps process hide amongst normal processes

APIs that perform Registry Operations
  - RegCreateKey
  - RegDeleteKey
  - RegSetValue

APIs for virtual memory
  - VirtualAlloc
  - VirtualProtect
  - NtCreateSection
  - WriteProcessMemory
  - NtMapViewOfSection
  
 ## Behaviour Identification with APIs
 
 Just because these APIs are in use =/= software is malicious.
 	- Context Matters
	- What are the parameters?
	- Sets of APIs used in sequence
	
Example 1) Process Hollowing
	CreateProcessA API to make new process in suspended mode
	sets dwCreationFlag parameter to CREATE_SUSPENDED
	This is a red flag because normal programs do not do this
Example 2) WriteProcessMemory
	Writes into memory of another process
	Debuggers use this so by itself - not malicious
	If also using VirtualAllocEx & CreateRemoteThread -> likely malware
	
	This is suspicious because of the Sequence the APIs are in
	
### Using Handle to Identify Sequences

Handle is a reference to files, registry, memory, and processes
Processes use handles to do operations on the referred object
Tracking handles -> identify sequence of APIs

# Static and Dynamic Analysis

Malware analysis process
obtain malware -> static/dynamic analysis -> reporting

Static Analysis -> analysis without execution
(hashing, embedded strings, PE header)

Dynamic analysis -> analysis with execution
(monitoring changes, behavior monitoring)

Snapshot clean system -> Execute Malware -> Take Snapshot
Compare two snapshots

## Dynamic Analysis tools
Regshot - registry snapshot
Autoruns - check for persistance
Fakenet - capture network traffic to other servers
Wireshark - 
Procmon
Procdot


Next we'll be doing a report on [Malware-sample-1](sample1-report).
